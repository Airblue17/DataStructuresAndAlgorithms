# Python Data Structures & Algorithms
Some of the data structures & algorithms I implemented in Python for practice

# Data Structures
-> LinkedList

-> Double LinkedList

-> Stack

-> Queue

-> HashTable (with a simple Hashing Funciton)

-> Binary Tree

-> Binary Search Tree

-> Graph

# Algorithms

-> Binary Search

-> Bubble Sort

-> Merge Sort

-> Quick Sort

-> Depth First Search

-> Breadth First Search

-> Shortest Path for Weighted Graph (Dijkstra's Algorithm)

-> Shortest Path for Unweighted Graph (BFS)

# Problems

-> 0-1 Knapsack
