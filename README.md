# Python Data Structures & Algorithms
Some of the data structures & algorithms I implemented in Python for practice

# Data Structures
-> LinkedList

-> Double LinkedList

-> Stack

-> Queue

-> HashTable (with a simple Hashing Funciton)

-> Binary Tree

-> Binary Search Tree

-> Graph

-> Trie

# Algorithms

-> Binary Search

-> Bubble Sort

-> Merge Sort

-> Quick Sort

-> Depth First Search

-> Breadth First Search

-> Shortest Path for Weighted Graph (Dijkstra's Algorithm)

-> Shortest Path for Unweighted Graph (BFS)

-> Strongly Connected Components for a Directed Graph (Kosaraju's Algorithm)

-> Topological Sorting

# Problems

-> 0-1 Knapsack

-> Kth Smallest Element in an Unsorted Array

-> Detect Cycle in an Undirected Graph

-> Letter Combinations of Phone Numbers

-> Contains Duplicate III

-> String to Integer(Atoi)

-> Roman to Integer

-> Swap Linked List Nodes in Pairs

-> Check if two binary trees are identical

-> Check if a tree is a valid BST

-> Delete Leaves with given target value

-> Decoded String at Index

-> Largest Number

-> Check if there exists duplicate subtree in a binary tree

-> merge two binary trees
